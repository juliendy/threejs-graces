# Ektogamat Three Graces Design Concept using threejs
<h4>by juliendy</h4>

In this project, I wanted to show that creating a design using #threejs is not as difficult as it looks. It has only 240 lines of code. The original design was created by Tom Bogner @dastom on Dribble: https://dribbble.com/shots/6767548-The-Three-Graces-Concept.

This project uses Threejs in vanillaJS with WebPack and is based on boilerplate from: https://github.com/ektogamat/threejs-andy-bolierplate.

# Getting Started
You need to have Node.js on your computer (https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Then, open your UID of choice, drag the project folder to it. Run the following commands:
```
npm install
```

Run this command in your terminal to open a local server at localhost:8080:
```
npm run dev
```

# Notes
This is for me to learn threejs more in depth. Any help or feedback is appreciated.
